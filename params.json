It is being developed by David Buzatto, as a part of his Ph.D. project at UNAERP (Universidade de Ribeirão Preto), with the advisement of Prof. Sônia Marli Zinagaretti.\r\n\r\nWe want to thank IFSP - Instituto Federal de Educação, Ciência e Tecnologia de São Paulo for the financial support.\r\n\r\n## Binary Releases\r\n\r\n[Version 1.2 - First Public Release](https://github.com/davidbuzatto/CryGetter/releases/download/1.2/CryGetter-1.2.zip)\r\n\r\n## Screenshots\r\n\r\n![CryGetter Main Interface](http://i.imgur.com/aOKZL1G.png) CryGetter Main Interface\r\n![CryGetter with a loaded data package ](http://i.imgur.com/pi8DYO2.png) CryGetter with a loaded data package \r\n![BtNomenclature data of Cry1Aa1 ](http://i.imgur.com/xPy3sM5.png) BtNomenclature data of Cry1Aa1 \r\n![Main data from NCBI related to Cry1Aa1 protein ](http://i.imgur.com/EFLV45E.png) Main data from NCBI related to Cry1Aa1 protein \r\n![References data from NCBI related to Cry1Aa1 protein ](http://i.imgur.com/sAdZ4Fh.png) References data from NCBI related to Cry1Aa1 protein \r\n![The complete sequence of Cry1Aa1 protein with domains 1 and 3 highlighted ](http://i.imgur.com/vGcaacT.png) The complete sequence of Cry1Aa1 protein with domains 1 and 3 highlighted \r\n![Domain 1 data of Cry1Aa1 protein sequence ](http://i.imgur.com/LUZ9v4l.png) Domain 1 data of Cry1Aa1 protein sequence \r\n![Cry1Aa1 model with 1CIY PDB identifier ](http://i.imgur.com/wiGuyDB.png) Cry1Aa1 model with 1CIY PDB identifier \r\n![Protein alignment interface](http://i.imgur.com/N03qd9I.png) Protein alignment interface\r\n![Protein alignment results](http://i.imgur.com/BPalZYQ.png) Protein alignment results\r\n![Protein analysis interface](http://i.imgur.com/5j7W9Qh.png) Protein analysis interface\r\n![Protein analysis results](http://i.imgur.com/OMZgjci.png) Protein analysis results\r\n![Amino acid details](http://i.imgur.com/XIOi5SK.png) Amino acid details\r\n![MSA algorithms configuration](http://i.imgur.com/UDpROwG.png) MSA algorithms configuration\r\n![Alignment visualization (CryGetter native)](http://i.imgur.com/oJXQRON.png) Alignment visualization (CryGetter native)\r\n![Alignment visualization (MView)](http://i.imgur.com/5wvnqiw.png) Alignment visualization (MView)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
