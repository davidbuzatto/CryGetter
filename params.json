  "body": "# Welcome to CryGetter Project Page!\r\n\r\nCryGetter is a software tool used to automaticaly retrieve Cry protein data and to offer means to analyse them. It is being developed by David Buzatto, as a part of his Ph.D. project at UNAERP (Universidade de Ribeirão Preto), with the advisement of Prof. Sônia Marli Zinagaretti. The tool was written using the Java programming language, so, to run the binary release, you will need to install a Java Virtual Machine (8.0 or higher) on your computer (click [here](http://www.java.com/) to download the latest version).\r\n\r\nWe want to thank IFSP - Instituto Federal de Educação, Ciência e Tecnologia de São Paulo for the financial support.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Binary Releases\r\n\r\n* [Version 1.02 - Changes related to NCBI API access mode.
