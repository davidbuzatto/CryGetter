# Welcome to CryGetter Project Page!

CryGetter is a software tool used to automaticaly retrieve Cry protein data and to offer means to analyse them. It was developed by David Buzatto, as a part of his Ph.D. project at UNAERP (Universidade de Ribeirão Preto), with the advisement of Prof. Sonia Marli Zinagaretti. The tool was written using the Java programming language, so, to run the binary release, you will need to install a Java Virtual Machine (8.0 or higher) on your computer (click [here](http://www.java.com/) to download the latest version).

We published a paper regarding the CryGetter tool in BMC Bioinformatics Journal! [Click here to access it!](http://bmcbioinformatics.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12859-016-1207-2)

We want to thank IFSP (Instituto Federal de Educação, Ciência e Tecnologia de São Paulo) and UNAERP (Universidade de Ribeirão Preto) for the financial support.
